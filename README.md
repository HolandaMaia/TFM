This project is a practical simulation tool developed by Matheus Holanda Maia. It integrates actuarial modeling with investment portfolio optimization to answer a key financial planning question:

> What periodic contributions are needed in an investment portfolio to reach the actuarial reserve required at retirement?

Unlike traditional approaches that separately analyze pension sufficiency or investment returns, this project combines both perspectives into a unified framework. The actuarial reserve becomes the financial target, and the investment strategy is optimized to achieve it.
